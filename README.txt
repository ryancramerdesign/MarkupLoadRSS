ProcessWire RSS Loader for ProcessWire 3.x
==========================================

Given an RSS feed URL, this module will pull it, and let you foreach() it 
or render it. This module will also cache feeds that you retrieve with it.

INSTALLATION
============

The MarkupLoadRSS module installs in the same way as all PW modules:

1. Copy the MarkupLoadRSS.module file to your /site/modules/ directory. 
2. Login to ProcessWire admin, click 'Modules' and 'Check for New Modules'. 
3. Click 'Install' next to the Markup Load RSS module. 


USAGE
=====

The MarkupLoadRSS module is used from your template files. 
Usage is described with these examples: 


Example #1: Cycling through a feed
----------------------------------

    $rss = $modules->get("MarkupLoadRSS"); 
    $rss->load("http://www.domain.com/articles/rss/");

    foreach($rss as $item) { 
        echo "<p>";
        echo "<a href='{$item->url}'>{$item->title}</a> ";
        echo $item->date . "<br /> ";
        echo $item->description; 
        echo "</p>";
    }


Example #2: Using the built-in rendering
----------------------------------------

    $rss = $modules->get("MarkupLoadRSS");
    echo $rss->render("http://www.domain.com/articles/rss/");


Example #3: Specifying options and using channel titles
-------------------------------------------------------

    $rss = $modules->get("MarkupLoadRSS");

    $rss->limit = 5;
    $rss->cache = 0; 
    $rss->maxLength = 255; 
    $rss->dateFormat = 'm/d/Y H:i:s';

    $rss->load("http://www.domain.com/articles/rss/");

    echo "<h2>{$rss->title}</h2>";
    echo "<p>{$rss->description}</p>";
    echo "<ul>"; 

    foreach($rss as $item) {
         echo "<li>" . $item->title . "</li>";
    }

    echo "</ul>";


OPTIONS
=======

Options MUST be set before calling load() or render().

    // specify that you want to load up to 3 items (default = 10)
    $rss->limit = 3;             

    // set the feed to cache for an hour (default = 120 seconds)
    // if you want to disable the cache, set it to 0.
    $rss->cache = 3600;          

    // set the max length of any field, i.e. description (default = 2048)
    // field values longer than this will be truncated
    $rss->maxLength = 255;

    // tell it to strip out any HTML tags (default = true)
    $rss->stripTags = true;

    // tell it to encode any entities in the feed (default = true); 
    $rss->encodeEntities = true;

    // set the date format used for output (use PHP date string)
    $rss->dateFormat = "Y-m-d g:i a";

See the $options array in the class for more options.

You can also customize all output produced by the render() method,
though it is probably easier just to foreach() the $rss yourself. But
see the module class file and $options array near the top to see how
to change the markup that render() produces. 


MORE DETAILS
============

This module loads the given RSS feed and all data from it. It then populates 
that data into a WireArray of Page-like objects. All of the fields in the RSS 
<items> feed are accessible, so you use whatever the feed provides.

The most common and expected field names in the RSS channel are: 

    $rss->title
    $rss->pubDate             (or $rss->date)
    $rss->description         (or $rss->body)
    $rss->link                (or $rss->url)
    $rss->created             (unix timestamp of pubDate)

The most common and expected field names for each RSS item are:

    $item->title
    $item->pubDate            (or $item->date)
    $item->description        (or $item->body)
    $item->link               (or $item->url)
    $item->created            (unix timestamp of pubDate)

For convenience and consistency, ProcessWire translates some common RSS 
fields to the PW-equivalent naming style. You can choose to use either the 
ProcessWire-style name or the traditional RSS name, as shown above.


HANDLING ERRORS
===============

If an error occurred when loading the feed, the $rss object will
have 0 items in it:

    $rss->load("...");
    if(!count($rss)) { error }

In addition, the $rss->error property always contains a detailed
description of what error occurred:

    if($rss->error) { echo "<p>{$rss->error}</p>"; }

I recommend only checking for or reporting errors when you are
developing and testing. On production sites you should skip
error checking/testing, as blank output is a clear indication
of an error. This module will not throw runtime exceptions so
if an error occurs, it's not going to halt the site.
